# Perseverance Calculator


<strong>Intro:</strong><br/>
This is a calculator with customizable buttons.  It also alows you to design math expressions or formulas with variables.
The "Program" tab is where the programming functions are located at.  It allows you to create buttons similarly to programming.
You can purchase this app from the Microsoft Store.


<strong>Status:</strong> <br/>
I'm still working on this project, but not that much (once every several months).
I'm usually busy.
There are many features I have not yet implemented, so it remains unfinished.


<strong>Features (TODO):</strong>
1. Graphing
2. Rearrange Formula
3. Additional buttons and programming buttons
4. Polynomial
5. Matrix
6. 3D graphing
7. 3D physics (for testing with 3d objects)
8. Scripting
9. Shader design
10. More...


<strong>My Vision:</strong><br/>
I wanted to create a Math Engine.  An engine that can do all kinds of math.  One where people can design their own formulas to solve problems that have never been solved before...  
I had a lot of ideas about this app, but unfortunately, I am not a mathematician.  


<strong>About:</strong><br/>
This is one of my first app before I attended University and learned C# from there.  It doesn't use any known design pattern (or one that I know of).  It is built with WinUI 3 and it uses Models, Views, and Logic.  
There is no controller or viewmodel, they are just logic.  The "Pages" folder should be within the "View" folder.


<strong>Reason for adding this project to github:</strong><br/>
I just wanted to create a portfolio.


<strong>Requirements:</strong><br/>
Listed in the Microsoft Store
Visual Studio
C#


<strong>Notes:</strong><br/>
For donations, just purchase this app from the Microsoft Store or share it with people.


<strong>Bug Warning:</strong><br/>
If the application shuts down in the middle of your work, it's just a bug.
